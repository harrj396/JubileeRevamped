This is a revamped version of a previous project I made with a team of 4 coders.  I will be expanding on ideas that we couldn't quite accomplish in our limited time frame of 1 week.

My original project [Jubilee](https://github.com/harrj396/Jubilee) and be found [here](https://github.com/harrj396/Jubilee)

# TODO
1: Redeploy through Heroku

2: Mobile support

3: Add MySQL support
